  <h1>If— by Rudyard Kipling</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="items">
        <div class="item">If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
        Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,</div>
        <div class="item">If you can trust yourself when all  men doubt you,<br>
        But make allowance for their doubting too;</div>
        <div class="item">If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
        Or being lied about, <br>
        don't deal in lies,</div>
        <div class="item">Or being hated, <br>
        don't give way to hating,<br>
        And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:</div>
        <div class="item">If you can dream-<br>
        and not make dreams your master;</div>
        <div class="item">If you can think-<br>
        and not make thoughts your aim;</div>
        <div class="item">If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
        And treat those two impostors just the same;</div>
        <div class="item">If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken,
        <br>Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,</div>
        <div class="item">Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
        And stop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:</div>
        <div class="item">If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
        And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,</div>
        <div class="item">And never breathe a word about your loss;</div>
        <div class="item">If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
        To serve your turn long after they are gone,</div>
        <div class="item">And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
        Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'</div>
        <div class="item">If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,</div>
        <div class="item">Or walk with Kings-nor lose the common touch,</div>
        <div class="item">If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, <br>
        If all men count with you,<br>
        but none too much;</div>    
        <div class="item">If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
        With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,</div>
        <div class="item">Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br>
        And-which is more-<br>
        you'll be a Man, my son!</div>
      </div>
    </div>
